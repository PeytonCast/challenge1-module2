This is my challenge submission for module 1. I was tasked with making this website more accessible so that it would better meet search engine optimization standards. I did my absolute best to improve the code without altering its original intent. The only visible difference is the slight change in background-color other than that everything functions as it should. As always I left the code a little cleaner than when I found it. You may notice when reading the code that there are more comments to help explain what is happening and clarify the purpose of the code. I did my best to make everything in the HTML semantic and logical. I hope you find this code easy to read and understand. -Peyton Castillo
